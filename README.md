# My Kickstart Configuration Files

## What is?

This is my Kickstart configuration files to create the smallest (but a little optimized for Japanese) linux images. I use this Kickstart to distribute it on AWS and use it myself.

By using this Kickstart, you can use Linux with the minimum required disk size. For example, you no longer need to use excess 8GB or 10GB disk images in AWS. (Starts from 2 GiB!)

## If you like it...

Let's see configurations in `config` directory. Known issues and memos are stored in `related` directory.

If you want to use in AWS quickly, let's launch my AMIs.
